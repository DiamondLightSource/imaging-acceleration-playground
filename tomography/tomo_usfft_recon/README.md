# Description: 

Fourier-based projection operators for tomography (forward/inverse Radon transform) that rely on FFT routines.  When implemented one can run various 
iterative schemes for reconstruction. Gradient descent being one of the simplest ones. Interpolation from the regular to irregular grid or vice versa is the core element of those methods. This one provided here in the gather kernel.
